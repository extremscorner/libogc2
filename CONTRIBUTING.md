LLM-generated contributions are not accepted. Reach a human if you don't understand what something does.

Please try to stick to established code styles, particularly for existing files. Nobody likes it, but it is what it is.

New, large components should not be added to this tree. What exists was inherited from old, pre-Git practices.

Please be mindful of the license of newly introduced dependencies, as it may have legal consequences for the projects using them. BSD/MIT/Zlib-type licenses are preferable, if not public domain.
It should be possible to opt-out of any (L)GPL dependencies.
